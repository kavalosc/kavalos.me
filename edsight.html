          <h3>What is Edsight?</h3>
          <p>
            Edsight is a free data analytics platform designed to assist
            educators in improving their teaching pedagogy (specifically for
            middle school math courses) through data and reflection. Edsight is
            designed to collect meaningful data of instructional practices and
            communicate trends to educators thus facilitating conversations
            around pedagogical improvements for teachers, coaches, and district
            leaders.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is part of a broader initiative called
            <a class="link" href="https://www.pmr2.org/">PMR2</a>, which is a
            multi-year research-practice partnership between university
            researchers and school district partners across the United States to
            develop a system of
            <b>practical measures, routines, and representations</b> to support
            the implementation of instructional improvement strategies in
            middle-school mathematics.

          <h3>Why Edsight needed a Design System</h3>
          <p>
            When we started out, the original version of Edsight was up and
            running but without a <b>design system</b> -
            <em
              >a design system is a comprehensive set of standards intended to
              manage design at scale using reusable components and
              patterns¬π.</em
            >
            The absence of a design system for Edsight proved to be a
            significant problem when we attempted to iterate on designs. We
            noticed in the designs, there were issues of consistency, which
            decreased the coherence of the platform. To resolve these issues, we
            spent some time developing an accessible and well-thought out design
            system for Edsight.

          <h3>Our Process</h3>
          <p>
            As we sat down as a team and began our brainstorming process, we
            took inspiration from the original Edsight webpage, created style
            tiles from our observations, and then created a mood board to
            outline our new thoughts and ideas for our design system.

          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <p>
            Since we decided to build our design system from scratch, we looked
            into other established design systems to get a better understanding
            of how a design system can be useful while designing. Throughout
            this process we learned how to organize our design system and the
            essential components of a design system. We also took note of how
            design systems reflected a company‚Äôs core values and identity
            through different component styles. Some of the design systems we
            looked at included Airbnb, Lyft, Meta, and Stanley Black & Decker.

          <h3>Redefining the Edsight brand</h3>
          <p>
            To establish the major themes and style of our design system, we
            created a mood board to collect inspiration and help brainstorm
            different ideas. From our brainstorming sessions, we identified a
            few key pillars for our design system:
            <b>friendly, schoolhouse, handwritten, warm, and in progress.</b>
          </p>
          <img src="assets/edsight/moodboard.svg" />
          <div class="caption">
            <p>Our mood board for Edsight 2.0</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            With Edsight being a tool for teachers to use in the classroom, we
            wanted to make sure that our design system reflected the aesthetics
            and atmosphere of a classroom. We took inspiration from different
            items typically found in a classroom to identify a few of our
            themes. Additionally, we modeled our mood board after PMR2‚Äôs
            practical measures. A key feature of Edsight is that it is ‚Äú<b
              >NOT</b
            >
            meant to be used for accountability or high-stakes, evaluation
            purposes‚Äù, so this inspired our <em>in progress</em> pillar, as we
            wanted our design system to feel more casual and low pressure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, we also looked at other education softwares, such as
            Khan Academy and Schoolhouse.world for modern inspiration. By doing
            so, we were able to create a comprehensive mood board to guide us
            throughout the creation of our design system.

          <h3>Key Insights We Learned</h3>
          <p>
            A key point of emphasis we kept in mind while building our design
            system was <b>accessibility</b>. We wanted to ensure that users with
            different backgrounds will be able to easily interact with our
            software. We focused on testing the color contrast for our brand
            colors using
            <a
              class="link"
              href="https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5"
              >Coolor‚Äôs color contrast checker</a
            >
            to make sure we had sufficient contrast across all of our
            components. This allows users to differentiate between different
            components. Additionally, we focused on choosing a font that has
            easily distinguishable height differences and characters so that it
            is readable in different contexts.
          </p>

          <h4>I. Typography</h4>
          <p>
            We did not realize certain typeface displays letters in a way that
            may decrease clarity and legibility. For instance, some typefaces
            display the letters ‚ÄúO‚Äù and ‚Äú0‚Äù or capitalized ‚ÄúI‚Äù and ‚ÄúL‚Äù
            similarly, causing readers to mistake them for each other. Keeping
            this in mind, we decided to pick the Work Sans as it distinguishes
            these similarities, increasing legibility and readability while
            maintaining our brand.
          </p>

          <h4>II. Color</h4>
          <p>
            Additionally, we picked out colors to match our branding while
            making sure there is enough color contrast between them. One thing
            we wanted to improve on was making our product accessible to
            color-blind users. To apply this accessibility practice, we put our
            colors in a color-blindness checker. We realize that red and greens
            are similar for color-blind users, and taking note of that, we
            decided to make sure we do not use these two colors together when
            designing our application.

          <h3>Edsight 2.0</h3>
          <h4>Color</h4>
          <p>
            When selecting our new color palette, we had two main items in mind:
            <b>accessibility & brand colors.</b> We wanted to make sure the
            colors were distinct enough from each other to uphold the standard
            for common color blindness tests while having a high enough color
            contrast ratio with our background. We tested various color
            combinations prior to settling on our 9 main colors.

          <h4>Typography</h4>
          <p>
            When selecting typography, we championed <b>clarity.</b> We compared
            o to 0 and I to l to 1 for legibility and distinguishability, before
            settling on the Work Sans font. In the comparisons of often mistaken
            characters, we looked for
            <b>how distinguishable these characters were from each other</b> to
            assess clarity. The Work Sans font ultimately had the clearest
            readability since it ensured each character was distinct and
            legible.

          <h4>Icons</h4>
          <p>
            When choosing icons for our branding, we focused on two aspects:
            <b>simple designs with recognizable imagery</b> to help users
            intuitively understand what each icon represents.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/edsight/icons.svg" />
          <div class="caption">

            </p>
          </div>
          <h4>Navigation Bar</h4>
          <p>
            Our navigation bar underwent many iterations before we settled on
            this current design. The main purpose of the navigation bar is to
            allow the user to <b>move easily</b> between different classes and
            navigate to their desired location. The expandable doubled
            navigation bar provides
            <b>flexibility without losing the ease of access.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Each navigation tab has an icon and text associated with it to avoid
            miscommunication and allow users to directly know what each tab
            represents. We found that icons alone can leave users wondering what
            the tab represents and ultimately make the navigation process harder
            and more time-consuming. Therefore, by adding simple text describing
            the page, the <b>understandability</b> of the tab navigation
            increases drastically.

          </div>
          <h4>Animations</h4>
          <p>
            For our animation designs, we used simple designs that could
            <b>easily be identified as symbols for loading.</b> Progress bars
            and loading dots are often associated with loading screens so users
            will be able to recognize these two concepts and more easily
            identify them as loading animations. In addition, they are colored
            with our branding‚Äôs color palette and fit to the minimalist theme.
            We used the Lottie extension in Adobe After Effects to export our
            animation designs.

          <h3>Implementing our design system</h3>
          <h4>Timeline Page</h4>
          <p>
            For our redesign of the timeline page, we focused on reducing the
            visual noise and creating a more simplistic view. If the user is
            presented with too much information all at once, it can seem
            overwhelming and push users to be less inclined to use the platform.
            Therefore, by presenting information in a more minimal way:
            combining smaller details, removing less relevant information, and
            using whitespace to show separation, the audience will be able to
            more easily digest the information presented on this page.

          <p>
            When redesigning the activity page, we kept in mind our target
            audience and usability. To optimize the functionality of the page,
            we decided to create a simpler view that would be easier for users
            to understand and navigate at a much quicker rate. The search and
            filter option was specifically modified to a more simplistic system
            for increased usability

          <h4>Class Manager Page</h4>
          <p>
            The redesigned Class Manager page uses color coordination and
            associated logos to help make courses easier to identify. In
            addition, classes can easily be added using a module, simplifying
            the process by keeping everything on the same page, rather than
            navigating away.

          <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
          <h4>
            1. Keep Human Centered Design practices into account when
            implementing our ideas into the mockups.
          </h4>
          <p>
            We were assigned weekly readings with topics that relate to
            improving the education systems, which we have applied the concepts
            we learned into our design process in hopes of improving the
            Edsight. A key practice we applied to our work is human-centered
            design. The first step is to understand the problem instead of
            jumping to create solutions. Since we are designing a product that
            would be used for teachers and instructional coaches, focusing on
            issues of cognitive load, attention, human perception, and data
            literacy would be beneficial in creating better experiences for
            users who often work collaboratively, have busy days with little
            structured time for reflection, and need to quickly pick up new
            tools.
          </p>
          <h4>
            2. Accessibility needs to be carefully considered in all design
            choices.
          </h4>
          <p>
            Our main goal was to keep accessibility in consideration throughout
            our design decisions to increase the user‚Äôs experiences when using
            Edsight. Initially, we understood that it is important to consider
            accessibility, but we did not realize how much small decisions
            matter. To expose ourselves to more accessibility practices, we read
            articles relating to this topic and realized that elements like
            typography and colors, even though they may be minor decisions to
            us, may cause a huge constraint and have a negative impact on
            potential users.
          </p>
          <h4>
            3. Communication between designers is important to maintain
            consistency even with a design system.
          </h4>
          <p>
            To keep things consistent, we have created a design system to manage
            our components, color, and text, allowing other designers to use the
            same elements throughout the design. Although we have a set design
            system, we ran into inconsistency issues when designing. A problem
            we ran into was not specifying the amount of spacing between cards
            and headers. Instead of assuming and estimating the spacing between
            these elements, we caught this early on and communicated the amount
            of spacing we should have between these elements. As projects get
            larger, it is common to miss elements in the initial planning
            process. Rather than having a lot to fix later, we minimize the
            number of changes by catching these missing elements, fixing them
            early on, and saving time in the long run.

          <h4>1. Get feedback on current designs.</h4>
          <p>
            Although the designs are fully fleshed out, we want to create the
            best experiences for our users. We plan to iterate with the feedback
            from researchers and former teachers we get from the design, making
            our designs as intuitive as possible.

            2. Start implementing consistent and accessible designs in React.
          </h4>
          <p>
            Transitioning to develop our designs, we plan to expand our team and
            include developers in the process of creating consistent and
            accessible products. With the team expanding, it may take more time
            for the developers to learn the consistency and accessibility
            concepts. Additionally, we want to explore more accessibility
            features that would potentially increase inclusivity for beyond
            users of colorblindness, such as users with difficult hearing or
            age-related barriers for Edsight.
