          <h3>Context</h3>
          <p>
            We are the Lilo design team from UC Irvine's
            <a href="https://sites.uci.edu/daplab/" class="link"
              >Design and Partnership Lab</a
            >
            (daplab). Our goal is to work together with community partners to
            make interactive learning tools and improve education. Specifically,
            we focus on helping students with the college enrollment process and
            preventing "summer melt", when accepted students decide not to
            attend college.
          </p>
        </div>

          <h3>Who is Lilo?</h3>
          <p>
            Lilo is a chatbot that supports high school graduates with their
            college enrollment process through text messages.
            <b
              >Our main goal was to address the problem of "summer melt," where
              accepted students decide not to go to college.</b
            >
            We studied different factors that contribute to this, such as
            practical challenges like missed deadlines and paperwork, as well as
            the social and emotional influences that affect a student's decision
            to attend college.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using natural language processing, Lilo effectively addresses a wide
            range of questions that students may have during the enrollment
            process. It has been trained with specific college information,
            allowing it to offer timely reminders and provide informative
            responses. Lilo also has features that help students think about
            their feelings and social worries. If students need more help, Lilo
            can connect them with experienced college mentors.

        <div class="row">
          <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
          <p>
            Due to limited access to counselors, numerous students lack the
            necessary support to express their nervousness about transitioning
            to college. However, relying on chatbots to address these needs can
            create conflicts as chatbots primarily focus on providing resources
            or quick responses to inquiries, often overlooking the emotional
            needs of students.
          </p>

            <b
              >How might we design an authentic chatbot that can provide
              highschool students a support system to express their concerns
              regarding the challenging transition to college?

        <div class="row">
          <h3>The Design Process</h3>
          <h4>Design System</h4>
          <p>
            We created a design system for Lilo with a goal of establishing a
            welcoming, playful, and relaxing atmosphere within the design. We
            aimed to create a minimalist and friendly experience to foster a
            sense of introspection and help students feel at ease while
            reflecting on their thoughts and feelings.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of the design system was to remain consistent throughout
            our design process, for a uniform look and feel. Along with updating
            the design system for a more cohesive look, we also updated Lilo to
            look and feel like a more playful robot.
          </p>

          <div class="caption">
            <p>
              Design Systems help us identify the visual brand of our website
              and stay consistent
            </p>
          </div>

          <h4>Sketches</h4>
          <p>
            We initially focused on creating sketches and low-fidelity
            wireframes for a task management dashboard that would help students
            track their enrollment-related tasks for college.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, as we got a better understanding of summer melt and how to
            design for AI, we realized we had to consider the socioemotional
            aspect of the college journey. Our new goal was to focus on helping
            students figure out their college identity, while also creating a
            sense of community to help students understand they are not going
            through this journey alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this new perspective, we went back to the drawing board to
            reimagine our initial sketches, transforming them into a more
            holistic and reflective journey towards college. Sketches were very
            important in our feedback process because it allowed us to give an
            idea of our vision without the need for full commitment in this
            design direction, allowing for more flexibility.
          </p>

          <h4>User Flow</h4>
          <p>
            The user flow diagrams helped to envision a new path for Lilo; one
            where the user is given the option of going through the chat, tasks,
            or reflection process in their own order. This helps navigate away
            from task-oriented Chat Bots, which was one of our main challenges,
            and helps users go at their own pace without overwhelming them. We
            needed to keep in mind the audience, high school students who are
            nervous or still unsure if they want to fully commit to college, and
            ensure we were providing for their possible personality types (A, B,
            C, D).
          </p>
          <img src="assets/lilo/userflow.svg" />
          <div class="caption">
            <p>User flow diagram</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            In addition, each respective option would lead to its own reward,
            this would in turn keep motivating students to continue completing
            each portion of the subsections. We also brainstormed different ways
            to market Lilo and attract users through various storyboards.
          </p>

          <h4>Storyboards</h4>
          <p>
            In our updated wireframes, we created a digital road trip concept
            that takes students on a journey towards college. The road trip
            consists of multiple stops, each representing a different task aimed
            at alleviating worries and providing valuable information about
            college life.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the start of the trip, students will be asked to reflect on what
            they are excited about and any concerns they might have regarding
            college. This input will be used to generate a personalized roadmap
            tailored to their specific needs and aspirations.
          </p>
          <p>
            At each stop along the road trip, students will have the opportunity
            to engage in a chat with Lilo, where they can seek guidance, ask
            questions, or express any concerns they may have. These interactions
            with Lilo will provide valuable support and information to the
            students.
          </p>
          <p>
            After visiting each stop, students will be encouraged to reflect
            once again, this time focusing on their excitement for college and
            any additional worries that may have arisen. This reflection process
            allows students to track their progress, gain confidence, and
            address any lingering concerns throughout their journey. In
            addition, using the information from this reflection, Lilo can
            update student’s roadmaps to fit their new concerns.
          </p>

          <h4>Wireframes</h4>
          <p>
            We made low fidelity wireframes to further envision Lilo’s direction
            and receive further feedback on what works and what needs to be
            changed.

            <p>Lo-Fi Wireframes</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            After more rounds of feedback we created mid fidelity wireframes,
            using the design system as a guide on the visual aspects, and the
            low fidelity wireframes to ensure all the essential content is
            addressed.

          <h3>Reflections</h3>
          <h4>Limitations & Next Steps</h4>
          <p>
            As the design progressed, we received constant feedback from the
            design team, however, we did not formally implement user testing for
            further feedback on our design decisions. User testing would have
            given a lot of insight on what actual high school students would
            want in Lilo, and show if they would actually be inclined to use
            Lilo in their college journey at all.
          </p>
          <h4>Challenges</h4>
          <p>
            Throughout the design process, we often encountered challenges; one
            main challenge was that when we were designing Lilo, it felt very
            standard in terms of how a chatbot and checklists work. This meant
            we were losing touch with the emotional aspects that Lilo initially
            was aimed to have at its forefront, this led us to think very long
            and hard about how to incorporate socio-emotional features into our
            design.
          </p>
          <p>
            To do this, we focused more on Lilo’s emotional chat sections and
            reflective portions of the site; in turn, we still used tasks as a
            way to help push students forward but designed them in a way that
            they are no longer at the forefront of what students have to do, but
            rather a resource they have available to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another challenge we faced was brainstorming ideas on how to get
            students to continue using Lilo. We brainstormed various ideas,
            however, they were all very task and progress oriented. Finally, we
            decided on creating motivation in the form of a rewards system.
          </p>
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>
            Redesigning Lilo posed a significant challenge for our design team
            as we found ourselves constrained by preconceived ideas, making it
            difficult to deviate from the original designs. At first, our
            initial task-oriented approach overlooked the impact of different
            personality types but through feedback sessions, we overcame these
            issues. Additionally, during these collaborative sessions, we
            actively considered the ethical implications of AI and how we wanted
            to support counselors rather than replace them, while creating
            authentic emotional connections over generic responses. With so many
            ideas, we took a step back and utilized lo-fi wireframes and user
            flows, allowing us to holistically visualize the user interaction
            and implement the desired features without overwhelming the
            students. After creating our mid-fi wireframes, we plan to seek
            further feedback from our research team to ensure we haven't
            overlooked any crucial pain points throughout the design process.
